<p>The story follows Jake, a young (~30) expat in France the 1920s. He and his friends all seem to love the same girl, Brett. Jake lives his normal partying/working life in Paris. He smooches Brett. Brett can’t be with him, but oh wouldn’t it be lovely if she could. They would have such a nice time together, they both agree. But oh no it cannot be, she declares. Jake then goes on a trip to Spain. He is to meet Brett, Mike (her fiance), Cohn (another chap in love with Brett), and Bill in Pamplona at the running of the bulls. First, Jake and Bill loaf around in other calmer parts of Spain. This is my favorite part of the book. Jake is off fishing by himself. He has a nap. He eats a sandwich. He looks at the mountains. Eventually, they get to the fiesta. It is a never ending drunkenness + violence festival. The bulls gore and smash and die and bang and bop. The people dance and yell and cry and punch and flop. Drama occurs. Brett affairs with Romano the young matador, Cohn gets upset, Mike gets upset, Jake gets hit in the face. When the waiter frowned at the death of some guy running from the bulls I told Ramsey (my friend) how I felt that the whole event was so insane, but no one seemed to notice. “Does anyone else see anything wrong here?”. This is similarly how I felt about the “group of friends” that are all in love with the same woman, and unnecessarily mean to Cohn. They’re rather anti-semitic. At some point, while watching a matador show, Jake tries to explain the process to Brett so that “she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors.” I didn’t buy it. Eventually, for the first and last time, I feel like someone in the book feels as I feel about the running of the bulls. Needless violence. It happens when someone gets gored and dies, and finally a waiter of Jake’s mentions how crazy the whole thing (that happens in his town every year) is. At the end of the fiesta Brett runs off with the matador. Everyone else slinks away to wherever they came from. Someone says something like “My God, it seems the beginning of the fiesta was ages ago”. I totally agree fictional character. I felt like I was in an endless loop of drinking and yelling and goring and smashing and banging and punching and crying and bopping and flopping. But nay, eventually it came to an end. Jake goes to relax in some part of France. This is my other favorite part of the book. Ah I feel like I can rest finally. He just walks around, gives someone a tip here and a smile there. Unfortunately, Brett telegrams him. He is to come to her at once in whatever city she’s in. Of course he does immediately. She’s in a room with a mess that only “comes from having servants all your life”. She kisses him. Tells him it didn’t work out with the matador. Oh Jake, how much fun we could have had together.</p>
<p>Things carry on. One generation cometh and another passeth away. The sun also ariseth, and doesn’t give a damn about your petty human bullshit.</p>

<p>“We’re all mad here,” says the Cheshire Cat to Alice. “I’m mad. You’re mad.” “How do you know I’m mad?” dear Alice wants to know. “You must be,” the cat tells her. “Or you wouldn’t have come here.”</p>
<p>Rather fittingly, I’ve no idea where I got this book. I only know that at some point, it was in my loft bookshelf. If I did a little investigating (between my roommates and myself) it’s possible that I’d remember it’s origins, but that’s no fun. So, let the nonsense begin.</p>
<p>To summarize, Alice is sitting idly with her sister when she spots something very surreal: a rabbit with a pocket watch! She can’t help but to follow the rabbit down a hole. Then, she sees nothing but surreal things for a few hours: disappearing cat, caterpillar smoking hookah, sentient pack of cards that organizes itself into a monarchy… Finally, she wakes up right next to her sister. Ha! Twas all naught but a dream. In what feels like an epilogue, her sister briefly dozes off and experiences some of the same magical characters. When she wakes up, she too sees it was all a dream, but!, she has a realization that seems to be the only semblance of value judgement in the whole story: She notes that Alice, with her wild imagination, will one day be able to tell cool stories to her little adorable children…</p>
<p>therefore</p>
<p>Imagination is good!</p>

<p>A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. 01/29/18</p>
<p>I picked this book up on Christmas day from my parents house. It’s only about 50 pages. So, I read an average of about 1.3 pages per day. Anyway…</p>
<p>Ah, what a classic tale! We’re introduced to this character that is bitterer than the butt of an asparagus: Ebenezer Scrooge, whose name has since been eponymized in our society (“You’re being such a Scrooge”). For seemingly no reason, Scrooge is simply a cold soulless grump.</p>
<p>“External heat and cold had little influence over Scrooge. No warmth could warm, nor wintry weather chill him.”</p>
<p>In the exposition, Dickens allows us to experience a day in the life of a plain old asshole. He declines his nephews dinner invitation, he points out the poverty of his own employee, and he scoffs in the face of charity collectors, throwing in quips about how people (and especially poor people) should be sad, locked in prison, or dead.</p>
<p>But then, Aha! Scrooge returns to his dank, creepy chambers where the ghost of his old partner Marley arrives to send him a message from the afterlife. This rather shakes our dear Scrooge to the core, and in being granted ghost-vision, he spots the spirit of a wealthy man (in life) chained to his chest of treasures, dragging it across the land. For the spirit within every man should “walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander the world… and witness what is cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!”</p>
<p>Then, our hero is catapulted into meeting with the three spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet To Come.</p>
<div id="the-spirit-of-christmas-past" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>The Spirit of Christmas Past:</strong></h3>
<p>The spirit of Christmas Past shows us the Ebenezer of yesteryear. Like any good prequel, perhaps we can get a chance now to see just why Scrooge is such an evil bastard. How has the world wronged him so that he should turn against the world altogether? Well, as it turns out Scrooge became an asshole mostly on his own. Not much really bad stuff happened in his past. In fact, he had some pretty cheerful times and supportive friends/family. He just slowly became more and more enveloped in business until it consumed him and voila! He’s a curmudgeon and his wife leaves him (which he doesn’t seem to care for too greatly).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-spirit-of-christmas-present" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>The Spirit of Christmas Present:</strong></h3>
<p>Christmas Present shows him that everyone thinks he’s an asshole.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-spirit-of-christmas-yet-to-come" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come:</strong></h3>
<p>Christmas of Yet to Come (who is basically the Grim Reaper) shows him that everyone still thinks he’s an asshole after he dies. As a final service from the Spirits, he is shown his own grave. Scrooge is absolutely terrified as the last of the three disappears. But that fear quickly turns to elation as he awakens in his bed, ready to spread cheer for the rest of his days. Then he goes on a Yuletide rampage giving away money, patting young lads on the head, and surprising nephews at dinner.</p>
<p>Now, Charles Dickens may not have given us the readers a reasonable story about why this apex asshole is the way he is, but what we do leave with is a solid message. There’s no time to slouch and grouch, for Death comes for us all! When He does, will you have lived a worthy life? Or will you be cursed to wander around the world chained to your worldly possessions that dragged you down in this life only to drag you down further in the next?</p>
